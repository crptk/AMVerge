My first brainstorm:

I figured I could create the algorithm by calculating the edges of a scene and then using that as the scene detect filter. So
basically:
1) Convert ep to find edges
2) For each frame, consider past 5 frames
3) Average past 5 frames, if it's over a threshold, consider, otherwise don't

This is fine, but this is more for smoothing, it's not really to detect change

To detect change, I need to essentially find the "difference" between each frame. By this I mean
literally subtracting one frame from the last. This would basically get the edges that overlap over each other only,
then I calculate the mean of that, if it's over the threshold, consider it, otherwise don't.

I'll keep thinking later about what i can do, I rly need a notebook lol


SUBTRACTION:

EDGEDETECT ALGORITHM:
- Heavily struggles on high action scenes since average content fluctutates 
  heavily. Lots of false positive on high action scenes.
